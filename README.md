## Broadening the net: Targeted scanning of media to enrich counter wildlife trade
intelligence efforts
## The Problem:
Intelligence is needed to combat wildlife trafficking, the basis of which is information. The
internet provides a rich vein of open-source information which is starting point for understanding
the patterns, trends and dynamics of the billion-dollar transnational illegal wildlife trade.
News reports are often the first notice we receive on significant trade events such as seizures of
contraband wildlife, or arrests and convictions of prominent wildlife criminals. We act quickly to
understand and develop the information, often comparing across multiple reports, and we then
manually integrate it with existing and subsequent research to build a constantly-developing
powerful all-source intelligence picture which directs our resources and facilitates government
and private sector actions.
However, as all NGOs operate with resource constraints, short time frames and stretched
budgets, the challenge is to identify, extract and collate pertinent data from specific sources in a
timely manner, an ability we’re currently missing because we’re reliant purely on slower manual
extract and replication methods.
